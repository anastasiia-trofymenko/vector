# 📦 Vector — University C++ Project

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a custom **Vector class** in C++, created as part of a university programming assignment.  
The project focuses on understanding core concepts of data structures, dynamic memory management, and template programming in C++.

It demonstrates how a dynamic array (similar to `std::vector`) can be implemented from scratch.

---

## ✨ Key Concepts

- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
- Custom container implementation
- Template-based generic programming
- Operator overloading
- Basic error handling and boundary checking
- Clean and structured C++ code

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C++** — core programming language
- **STL concepts** — inspiration for container behavior
- **Git / GitHub** — version control

## 👩‍💻 My Role

This project was completed individually as part of a **university C++ course**.

My responsibilities included:

- Designing and implementing a custom vector container
- Managing dynamic memory manually
- Using templates to support different data types
- Overloading operators for intuitive usage
- Writing clear and maintainable code

## 🚀 How to Use

This project is intended as a **library-style implementation**.

To use the vector class in your own project:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anastasiia-trofymenko/vector.git
```

2. Include `vector.h` in your C++ source file:
```cpp
#include "vector.h"
```

3. Compile your project with a C++ compiler (example using g++):
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o app
```
